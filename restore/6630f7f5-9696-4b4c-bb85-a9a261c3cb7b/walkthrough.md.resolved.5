# Syndicate Tracker & Psych Dashboard Refinements

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Syndicate Tracker Upgrade
- **Grouped View (Excel-Style)**: Added a "Grouped" view mode to cluster applications by IPO Name. This makes handling multiple applications for the same IPO cleaner.
- **Bulk Entry Flow**:
    - When you add an application, the "IPO Name" and "Amount" persist, while "Applicant" and "UPI" reset.
    - The cursor auto-focuses on "Applicant Name".
- **Autocomplete Memory**:
    - "Applicant" and "UPI ID" fields now remember previous entries.
    - When you type, improved autocomplete suggestions appear (e.g., typing "S" shows "Self", "Son", etc. if used before).
- **Listing Price Mode**: Added an option to calculate profit using **Listing Price** vs **Issue Price**.
- **Sync Fix**: Connected the "Realize Gains" action directly to the main Portfolio refresh trigger.

### 2. Psych Dashboard (Mistake Tags)
- **Dynamic Tags**: You can now type a custom mistake tag (e.g., "Fat Finger") and add it to your trade log instantly.
