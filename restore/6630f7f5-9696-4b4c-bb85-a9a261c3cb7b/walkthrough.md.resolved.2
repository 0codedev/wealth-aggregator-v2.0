# Walkthrough - Real Financial Data Population

I have populated the **Financial Calendar** widget with comprehensive, real-world data for December 2024 and January 2025.

## Changes

### 1. [FinancialCalendar.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/widgets/FinancialCalendar.tsx)
- **Data Integration**: Added 20+ real data points across three categories:
    - **Corporate Bonds (NCDs)**: Including IIFL Home Finance, Muthoot Fincorp, Edelweiss, and a large issue from 360 ONE Prime.
    - **Dividends**: Including Can Fin Homes, Red Tape, TCS (Interim), and Angel One.
    - **IPOs**: Updated with accurate dates for Transrail Lighting, Unimech Aerospace, Standard Glass, and several SME IPOs like Identical Brains.
- **Filtering Logic**: Ensured the 'ALL', 'IPO' (Mainboard/SME), 'DIVIDENDS', and 'BONDS' filters correctly segment this new dataset.

## Verification Results

### Automated Checks
- `tsc` compilation passed with **exit code 0**.

### Visual Verification (Expected)
- **Calendar Widget**:
    - Clicking **BONDS** should now show the "IIFL Home Finance" and "360 ONE Prime" issues.
    - Clicking **DIVIDENDS** should show "TCS" and "Angel One" in Jan 2025.
    - Clicking **IPO > SME** should show "Identical Brains" and "Newmalayalam Steel".
