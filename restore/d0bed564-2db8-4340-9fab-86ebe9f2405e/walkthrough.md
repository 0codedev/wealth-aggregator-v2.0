# Walkthrough - Jupiter Analytics & Real Data

I have completely revamped the Analytics experience to match your Jupiter app request.

## 1. Jupiter Analytics Widget
**The new hero of the Analytics tab.**
-   **Split View**: A professional layout with controls on the left and a large, immersive chart on the right.
-   **Three-Mode Tracking**:
    -   **Spends**: Tracks your expenses.
    -   **Invested**: Filters for 'Investment' category transactions.
    -   **Incoming**: Tracks your credits/income.
-   **Dynamic Graph**:
    -   **Cumulative Mode**: Shows how your spending/investing accumulates over the month (just like the image).
    -   **Daily Mode**: Toggle to see daily spikes.
-   **Top Categories**: A scrollable, auto-sorted list of where your money went for the selected month.

## 2. Real Data Integration
-   **Net Worth**: Connected to your CSV's `current_balance` for 100% accuracy.
-   **Auto-Filter**: The Jupiter widget automatically processes your CSV data to separate Investments from Spends based on category keywords.

## 3. "Zone Run" Calendar
-   Still available below the main widget for that quick "heat map" view of your month.

## Verification
1.  Go to the **Analytics** tab.
2.  See the new **Jupiter Widget** at the top.
3.  Click "Invested" to see your investment curve.
4.  Use the Month arrows ("< November 2025 >") to navigate back in time.
5.  Check the **Graph** on the right updating instantly.
