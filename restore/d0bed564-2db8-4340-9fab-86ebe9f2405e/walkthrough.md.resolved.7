# Walkthrough - Spending Hub & UX Refinements

I have refined the Spending Hub experience with enhanced interactions and management tools.

## 1. Import Flow (Fixed)
The Import button (`+`) now triggers a dedicated **Bank Import Modal** instead of a silent file picker.
- Click `+` in the header.
- Drop your CSV/PDF statement in the modal.
- See an AI simulation analyzing your spending.
- Review parsed categories before confirming.

## 2. Account Management (Enhanced)
I upgraded the "Manage" mode for Linked Accounts:
- **Edit Mode**: Click "Manage" to reveal overlay actions.
    - **Pencil Icon**: Opens a popup to edit the account's Name, Number, and Balance.
    - **Trash Icon**: Removes the account (with confirmation).
- **Clear Data**: Added a subtle "Clear All App Data" button at the bottom of the page to reset the app state if needed.

## 3. Timeline & Analytics
- **Date Filter**: Verified functionality in Timeline tab.
- **Charts**: Analytics tab remains fully integrated.

## Verification
- **Import**: Try importing a CSV file using the new Modal.
- **Edit Account**: Click "Manage" -> Pencil Icon -> Change "SBI" to "HDFC" -> Save.
- **Delete**: Remove an account and verify it disappears.
