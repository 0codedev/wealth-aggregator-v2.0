# Walkthrough - Analytics & Visuals Upgrade

I have completely revamped the **Analytics** tab to match the "Fold Money" aesthetic, introducing rich data visualizations and interactive charts.

## 1. Top-Level Trends
I added two new powerful widgets to the top of the Analytics view:
- **Net Worth Trend**: An interactive **Area Chart** tracking your wealth over time.
    - **Control**: Toggle between **1M**, **3M**, and **6M** timelines to see your growth.
    - **Visuals**: Gradient green fills and custom tooltips.
- **Monthly Burn Rate**: A **Line Chart** that compares your *current* cumulative spending vs. *last month*.
    - **Insight**: Instantly see if you are spending faster or slower than usual.
    - **Alerts**: Dynamic alerts appear if you are "Spending too fast" (e.g., +8% vs last month).

## 2. Visual Polish
- **Dark Mode Optimization**: All charts now have "Slate-900" compatible dark mode styles.
- **Custom Tooltips**: Replaced default browser tooltips with custom, dark-themed floating tooltips for a premium feel.
- **Heatmap Upgrade**: The Daily Pulse heatmap now has cleaner rounded squares and better hover effects.

## 3. Account Management (Recap)
- **Import Modal**: Verified working.
- **Edit/Delete**: Verified working.

## Verification
- **Check Trends**: Go to **Spending Hub** -> **Analytics**.
- **Interact**: Hover over the Line Chart to compare "Today" vs "Last Month". click "3M" on the Net Worth chart.
