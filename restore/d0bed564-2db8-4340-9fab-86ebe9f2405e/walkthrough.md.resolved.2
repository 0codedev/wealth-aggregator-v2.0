# Restored Premium Dark Aesthetics

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Portfolio Toolbar Fixes
- **Problem**: The previous toolbar used a glass effect (`bg-white/80` / `dark:bg-slate-900/80`) that washed out colors and looked "milky" or "too bright" against the dark background.
- **Fix**: Switched to a solid **Dark Slate** background (`dark:bg-slate-950`) to match the app's deep contrast theme.
- **Detail**: Active tabs now use **Indigo-600** (Solid) instead of Slate-700 (Gray), aligning with the Sidebar's established design language.

### 2. Holdings Card Refinement
- **Problem**: Hover states on asset cards were lightening the background (`bg-slate-800/50`), contributing to the "bright" feeling.
- **Fix**: Hover states now rely on **Subtle Indigo Borders** and **Shadows** (`shadow-indigo-500/15`), keeping the card background dark and premium.

## Verification

### Checklist
- [x] Toolbar background is solid dark (no glass).
- [x] "Holdings" active pill is **Indigo**.
- [x] Asset cards remain dark on hover.

### 3. Widget Aesthetic Refinement
- **Problem**: The "Credit Card Optimizer" widget used a bright orange gradient that was visually jarring and mismatched the dark theme.
- **Fix**: Replaced the gradient with the standard **Card Component Style** (`bg-white dark:bg-slate-900`) and standard text colors, aligning it with other widgets like the UPI Tracker.

### 4. Import Interaction & Styling Fixes
- **Problem (Interaction)**: The file input in the "Import Bank Statement" modal was covering the close button, causing file manager to open when clicking "X".
- **Fix**: Restricted file input to the drag-and-drop zone using `relative` positioning.
- **Problem (Aesthetic)**: "Investment Clubs" used a purple gradient that clashed with the app theme.
- **Fix**: Applied standard dark theme (`bg-white dark:bg-slate-900`) and indigo accents.
