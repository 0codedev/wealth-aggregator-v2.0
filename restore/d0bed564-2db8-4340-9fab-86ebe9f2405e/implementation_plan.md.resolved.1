# Styles Refinement Plan

## Goal Description
The user reported that the **Credit Card Optimizer** widget has a "vibrant orange" gradient (`from-amber-500 to-orange-500`) that is visually jarring and "burning their eyes". The goal is to replace this with the standard application aesthetic (Dark Slate/White background with Indigo/Slate accents) to ensure consistency and visual comfort.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> I will also check other widgets defined in [GodTierFeatures.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/shared/GodTierFeatures.tsx) for similar outliers, though the user specifically called out the orange one.

## Proposed Changes

### Components

#### [MODIFY] [GodTierFeatures.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20(3)/components/shared/GodTierFeatures.tsx)
- **CreditCardOptimizer**:
    - Remove: `bg-gradient-to-br from-amber-500 to-orange-500`
    - Add: `bg-white dark:bg-slate-900 border border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-800` (Standard Card Style)
    - Heading: Change text color from `text-white` to `text-slate-900 dark:text-white`.
    - Content: Update inner card backgrounds from `bg-white/20` (glass on orange) to `bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-800`.
    - Text: Update text colors from `text-amber-100` to `text-slate-500`.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **Visual Check**: Open the Dashboard tab.
2.  **Locate Widget**: Find "Credit Card Optimizer".
3.  **Confirm Style**: Ensure it looks like the "UPI Spending Tracker" widget (clean dark card) and not a bright orange box.
