# Walkthrough - Timeline & Spending Hub Upgrades

I have successfully enhanced the Spending capabilities with a new "Fold-like" Spending Hub and a fully featured Timeline view.

## 1. Spending Analytics Hub
I created a centralized [SpendingAnalyticsHub](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/hubs/SpendingAnalyticsHub.tsx#14-77) that organizes your spending data into three intuitive tabs, similar to premium finance apps:
- **Overview**: Your Smart Feed, Widgets, and Spending Summaries.
- **Timeline**: The new transaction list with powerful filtering.
- **Analytics**: Detailed charts and heatmaps.

## 2. Timeline Tab Enhancements
The [TransactionTimeline](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/TransactionTimeline.tsx#31-264) has been completely rebuilt with:
- **Performance**: Implemented "Load More" virtualization for smooth scrolling of large transaction lists.
- **Visuals**: 
    - Transactions are now color-coded (Green for Credit, Red for Debit).
    - Bank names (SBI, ICICI) are displayed with distinct colored badges/icons.
- **Grouping**: Transactions are grouped by date with daily "Net Spend" calculations.
- **Search & Filter**: 
    - Search by merchant or amount.
    - Functional Category Filter dropdown.

## 3. Data Integration
- **Bank Parsing**: Updated the CSV parser to specifically extract `bank_name` from your data files.
- **Routing**: Integrated the new Hub into the main Dashboard via the "Power Features" grid.

## Verification
- **Navigation**: Click the "Spending" card in the Power Features section to open the Hub.
- **Interaction**: Switch to "Timeline" tab to see your transactions grouped by date.
- **Feature Check**: Verify that "Credit" transactions are green and bank names appear next to merchants.
