# App Launch Fix Walkthrough

## Summary
The application was failing to launch due to a corrupted file ([SpendingAnalytics.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/SpendingAnalytics.tsx)) which caused a syntax error in the build process. I investigated the error, identified the culprit, and replaced the corrupted file with a valid placeholder component. The application now launches and loads the dashboard successfully.

## Changes Made
- **Fixed Corrupted File**: Replaced the content of [components/dashboard/spending/SpendingAnalytics.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/SpendingAnalytics.tsx) with a placeholder React component.

## Verification
### Automated Checks
- `npm run dev` (Vite) runs without errors.

### Manual Verification
- Navigated to `http://localhost:3000`.
- Verified that the dashboard loads and displays main widgets (Net Worth, Market Status, etc.).
- Confirmed that the "blank screen" or crash on launch is resolved.

## Notes
- The [SpendingAnalytics.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/SpendingAnalytics.tsx) file was truncated/corrupted. I replaced it with a simple "Under Maintenance" placeholder. If the original code for this specific component is needed, it should be restored from a previous backup if available, or rewritten based on requirements. For now, the app is fully functional otherwise.
