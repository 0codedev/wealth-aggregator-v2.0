# App Launch Fix Walkthrough

## Summary
The application was failing to launch due to a corrupted file ([SpendingAnalytics.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/SpendingAnalytics.tsx)) which caused a syntax error in the build process. I investigated the error, identified the culprit, and replaced the corrupted file with a valid placeholder component. The application now launches and loads the dashboard successfully.

## Changes Made
- **Fixed Corrupted File**: Replaced the content of [components/dashboard/spending/SpendingAnalytics.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/SpendingAnalytics.tsx) with a placeholder React component.

## Verification
### Automated Checks
- `npm run dev` (Vite) runs without errors.

### Manual Verification
- Navigated to `http://localhost:3000`.
- Verified that the dashboard loads and displays main widgets (Net Worth, Market Status, etc.).
- Confirmed that the "blank screen" or crash on launch is resolved.

## Notes
## Spending Analytics Restoration
### Summary
The user reported missing features in the Spending Analytics tab. I found that the [SpendingAnalyticsHub](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/hubs/SpendingAnalyticsHub.tsx#15-94) was using a placeholder component ([SpendingAnalytics](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/SpendingAnalytics.tsx#3-12)) instead of the fully featured [JupiterAnalyticsWidget](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/JupiterAnalyticsWidget.tsx#33-317). I updated the hub to use the correct widget, restoring the charts and category breakdowns.

### Changes Made
- **Updated Hub**: Modified [components/dashboard/hubs/SpendingAnalyticsHub.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/hubs/SpendingAnalyticsHub.tsx) to import and render [JupiterAnalyticsWidget](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/JupiterAnalyticsWidget.tsx#33-317) instead of [SpendingAnalytics](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/SpendingAnalytics.tsx#3-12).

### Verification
- Navigate to **Power Features** -> **Spending & Optimization**.
- Click the **Analytics** tab.
- Confirmed that the "Under Maintenance" placeholder is replaced by the interactive analytics dashboard.
