# Restore Spending Analytics Features

## Goal Description
The "Spending Analytics" tab currently shows a placeholder because the original file was corrupted and replaced. I will restore the full functionality by integrating the existing [JupiterAnalyticsWidget](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/JupiterAnalyticsWidget.tsx#33-317), which contains the rich analytics features (graphs, category breakdowns) that the user expects.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> I am replacing the placeholder [SpendingAnalytics](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/SpendingAnalytics.tsx#3-12) with [JupiterAnalyticsWidget](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/JupiterAnalyticsWidget.tsx#33-317). This assumes [JupiterAnalyticsWidget](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/JupiterAnalyticsWidget.tsx#33-317) is the correct, intended component for this view.

## Proposed Changes

### Components

#### [MODIFY] [SpendingAnalyticsHub.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/hubs/SpendingAnalyticsHub.tsx)
- Change import from [SpendingAnalytics](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/SpendingAnalytics.tsx#3-12) to [JupiterAnalyticsWidget](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/JupiterAnalyticsWidget.tsx#33-317).
- Replace `<SpendingAnalytics />` with `<JupiterAnalyticsWidget />`.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- `npm run dev` should continue to pass.

### Manual Verification
- Navigate to the Dashboard.
- Click on "Power Features" > "Spending" (or finding the way to the Spending Hub).
- Click the "Analytics" tab.
- Verify that the rich charts and lists appear instead of the "Under Maintenance" message.
