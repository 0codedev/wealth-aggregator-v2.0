# Fix Corrupted SpendingAnalytics Component

## Goal Description
The application fails to launch due to a syntax error in [components/dashboard/spending/SpendingAnalytics.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/SpendingAnalytics.tsx). The file appears to be corrupted (truncated). I will replace the corrupted content with a valid placeholder component to allow the build to succeed and the app to launch.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I am replacing the corrupted file with a placeholder. If this component was crucial for specific analytics visualization, we may need to recover the original code from a backup or use [JupiterAnalyticsWidget.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/JupiterAnalyticsWidget.tsx) as a replacement.

## Proposed Changes

### Components

#### [MODIFY] [SpendingAnalytics.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gadda/Downloads/wealth-aggregator-v1.1%20%283%29/components/dashboard/spending/SpendingAnalytics.tsx)
- Replace the corrupted content (closing tags only) with a functional React component stub.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run dev` and ensure the build error is resolved.
- Use the browser to navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and confirm the app loads.

### Manual Verification
- Check the terminal output for successful build.
- Visually inspect the dashboard to see if "Spending Analytics Widget" (the placeholder text) appears, indicating where the component is used.
